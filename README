1. Open gen_inputs.sh. You can change the number of steps by replacing 
the value of init_steps and consequent_steps in the file. 

init_steps = 2000000, number of MC steps from gammaV=1 to gammaV_init=0.8 
(default)
consequent_steps = 100000, number of MC steps in between gammaV_init to 
gammaV_fin, incrementing -0.01
You can also change gammaV_init and gammaV_fin, just make sure to match 
them later in the gen_outputs.sh 

2. Run ./gen_inputs.sh
It should create an inputs folder

3. Open gen_outputs.sh.
Match the input_foldername with the input_foldername used in gen_inputs.sh,
as well as the gammaV_init and gammaV_fin values.
Increase number of replicates if need more shapes.

4. Run ./gen_outputs.sh
It should create an outputs folder containing several different output 
folder for each gammaV and each replicate.
